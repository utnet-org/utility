# UNC Indexer

UNC Indexer is a micro-unc-infra. which provides you with a stream of blocks that are recorded on UNC network. It is useful to handle real-time "events" on the chain.

## Rationale

As scaling dApps enter UNCâ€™s mainnet, an issue may arise: how do they quickly and efficiently access state from our deployed smart contracts, and cut out the cruft? Contracts may grow to have complex data structures and querying the network RPC may not be the optimal way to access state data. The UNC Indexer Framework allows for streams to be captured and indexed in a customized manner. The typical use-case is for this data to make its way to a relational database. Seeing as this is custom per project, there is engineering work involved in using this unc-infra.

UNC Indexer is already in use for several new projects, namely, we index all the events for UNC Blockchain Explorer, and we also dig into Access Keys and index all of them for UNC Wallet passphrase recovery and multi-factor authentication. With UNC Indexer you can do high-level aggregation as well as low-level introspection of all the events inside the blockchain.

We are going to build more Indexers in the future, and will also consider building Indexer integrations with streaming solutions like Kafka, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and NoSQL databases. Feel free to [join our discussions](https://github.com/utnet-org/utility/issues/2996).

See the [example](https://github.com/utnet-org/utility/tree/master/tools/indexer/example) for further technical details.

## How to set up and test UNC Indexer

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following software installed:
* [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or Rust version that is mentioned in `rust-toolchain` file in the root of unc-infra.project.

### localnet

Clone [unc-infra.(https://github.com/utnet-org/utility)

To run the UNC Indexer connected to a network we need to have configs and keys prepopulated. To generate configs for localnet do the following

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:utnet-org/utility.git
$ cd unc-infra.tools/indexer/example
$ cargo run --release -- --home-dir ~/.unc/localnet init
```

The above commands should initialize necessary configs and keys to run localnet in `~/.unc/localnet`.

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --home-dir ~/.unc/localnet/ run
```

After the node is started, you should see logs of every block produced in your localnet. Get back to the code to implement any custom handling of the data flowing into the indexer.

Use [unc-shell](https://github.com/unc/unc-shell) to submit transactions. For example, to create a new user you run the following command:

```bash
$ unc_ENV=local unc --keyPath ~/.unc/localnet/validator_key.json \
       create_account new-account.test.unc --masterAccount test.unc
```


### testnet / betanet

To run the UNC Indexer connected to testnet or betanet we need to have configs and keys prepopulated, you can get them with the UNC Indexer Example like above with a little change. Follow the instructions below to run non-validating node (leaving account ID empty).

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --home-dir ~/.unc/testnet init --chain-id testnet --download
```

The above code will download the official genesis config and generate necessary configs. You can replace `testnet` in the command above to different network ID `betanet`.

**NB!** According to changes in `unc-infra. config generation we don't fill all the necessary fields in the config file. While this issue is open <https://github.com/utnet-org/utility/issues/3156> you need to download config you want and replace the generated one manually.
 - [testnet config.json](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.utility.com/unc-infra.deploy/testnet/config.json)
 - [betanet config.json](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.utility.com/unc-infra.deploy/betanet/config.json)
 - [mainnet config.json](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.utility.com/unc-infra.deploy/mainnet/config.json)

Replace `config.json` in your `--home-dir` (e.g. `~/.unc/testnet/config.json`) with downloaded one.

After that we can run UNC Indexer.

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --home-dir ~/.unc/testnet run
```

After the network is synced, you should see logs of every block produced in Testnet. Get back to the code to implement any custom handling of the data flowing into the indexer.


You can choose Indexer Framework sync mode by setting what to stream:
 - `LatestSynced` - Real-time syncing, always taking the latest finalized block to stream
 - `FromInterruption` - Starts syncing from the block UNC Indexer was interrupted last time
 - `BlockHeight(u64)` - Specific block height to start syncing from

 Refer to `main()` function in [Indexer Example](https://github.com/utnet-org/utility/blob/master/tools/indexer/example/src/main.rs)

Indexer Framework also exposes access to the internal APIs (see `Indexer::client_actors` method), so you can fetch data about any block, transaction, etc, yet by default, unc-infra.is configured to remove old data (garbage collection), so querying the data that was observed a few epochs before may return an error saying that the data is not found. If you only need blocks streaming, you don't need this tweak, but if you need access to the historical data right from your Indexer, consider updating `"archive"` setting in `config.json` to `true`:

```json
...
"archive": true,
...
```
