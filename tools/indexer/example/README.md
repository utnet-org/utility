Utility Indexer Simple Logger Example
==================================

This is an example project featuring [Utility Indexer Framework](https://github.com/utnet-org/utility/tree/master/chain/indexer). This Indexer prints out all the blocks, chunks, transactions, receipts, execution outcomes, and state changes block by block immediately once it gets finalized in the network.

Refer to the Utility Indexer Framework README to learn how to run this example.
