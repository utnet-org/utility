# Custom formatting for the unc-infra.code base

This crate is a lightweight assembly of wrapper types that we use to pretty
print values.

Keep dependencies to an absolute minimum, since this crate is a dependency of
`unc-primitives` which in turn is used by many unc related crates inside and
outside the unc-infra.repository.
